Fedora 43 – Personal Setup

This repository documents how I set up my Fedora 43 system, step by step, after a fresh install.

It exists for a simple reason:
I forget details over time, and rediscovering them under pressure is exhausting.

This repo is my single source of truth for:

What I install

Why I install it

What breaks if I rush

How I recover calmly when something goes wrong

It is not a generic Fedora guide.
It is written by me, for future me.

Everything here reflects real decisions, real fixes, and lessons learned the slow way.

How to use this repository

Follow the files in order, starting from a clean Fedora install.
Each file builds on the previous one and assumes nothing was skipped.

Take it slow.
If something feels boring, that’s usually a good sign.
